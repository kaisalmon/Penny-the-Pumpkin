# Penny the Pumpkin

A **metroidvania-style platformer** developed for the PICO-8 fantasy console. Originally released in **March 2024** with a major **Director's Cut expansion** in **May 2024**, showcasing iterative development and community engagement.

*PICO-8 is a "fantasy console" that emulates 1980s hardware limitations - 128x128 resolution, 16 colors, 32KB memory limit - requiring creative optimization and efficient programming.*

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Core Features:**
- **Exploration-based gameplay** - Interconnected world with 7 distinct areas
- **Shape-shifting mechanics** - Unique stretch/compress abilities for puzzle-solving  
- **Progressive difficulty** - Coin collection with persistent save system
- **Speedrun mode** - Competitive time attack with community leaderboards

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Custom level system** - Efficient rendering of large game world within memory constraints
- **Physics simulation** - Spring-based character movement and collision detection
- **Asset optimization** - Advanced tile compression and dynamic loading systems
- **Save state management** - Progress persistence across game sessions

## üìä Development & Iteration

**Version Timeline:**
- **March 2024**: Initial release (12 collectible coins, 7 areas)
- **May 2024**: Director's Cut expansion (18 coins, complete content overhaul)
- **Ongoing**: Community-driven bug fixes and improvements

**Community Response:**
- **Active speedrunning scene** - Players competing for sub-3-minute completion times
- **Content creation** - Streaming and walkthrough videos by community members
- **Feature feedback** - Player suggestions directly influenced expansion development
- **Technical discussions** - Code implementation shared with PICO-8 development community

## üîß Technical Challenges

**Platform Constraints:**
- **32KB total size limit** - Entire game logic, assets, and data compressed within cartridge
- **Performance optimization** - 60fps gameplay despite computational complexity of physics and rendering
- **Memory management** - Efficient data structures for world state and asset streaming
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Consistent experience across browser, desktop, and mobile

**Development Skills Applied:**
- **Algorithm optimization** - Efficient collision detection and physics simulation, since all physics was written from scratch
- **Resource management** - Asset compression and dynamic loading within memory limits
- **User experience design** - Intuitive controls and feedback within 128x128 pixel constraint
- **Community engagement** - Iterative development based on player feedback and bug reports

## üèÜ Project Impact

- **Featured content** on PICO-8 BBS platform and itch.io metroidvania collections
- **Community engagement** with active player base creating content and competing in speedruns
- **Technical documentation** shared with development community for educational purposes
- **Iterative improvement** demonstrating full product lifecycle from initial release to major expansion

## üìã Development Notes

This project demonstrates **constrained programming** - solving complex technical problems within artificial hardware limitations. Key areas include efficient algorithm design, memory optimization, and performance tuning while maintaining engaging gameplay and visual polish.

The iterative development cycle from initial release to Director's Cut expansion shows practical experience with community feedback integration, feature prioritization, and product evolution based on user engagement.
